            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>1 shot of espresso (about 1 ounce)</li>
                <li>8 ounces of steamed milk</li>
                <li>Optional: Sugar or sweetener to taste</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
                Start by brewing a shot of espresso using your preferred method. This typically involves using an
                espresso machine, but you can also use a stovetop espresso maker or a French press.
                While the espresso is brewing, steam the milk using a milk frother or steam wand on your espresso
                machine. Heat the milk until it reaches a temperature of about 150-160°F (65-70°C). Be careful not to
                overheat or scald the milk.
                Once the espresso and milk are ready, pour the espresso into a coffee cup.
                Slowly pour the steamed milk over the espresso, holding back the foam with a spoon to allow mostly milk
                to pour first.
                Spoon some of the foam on top of the latte.
                If desired, sweeten your latte with sugar or your preferred sweetener.
                Give the latte a gentle stir to combine the espresso and milk.
                Serve immediately and enjoy your café latte!
