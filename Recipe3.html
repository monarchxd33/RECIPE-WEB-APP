        <div class="recipe">
            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 oz (45 ml) white rum</li>
                <li>1/2 oz (15 ml) freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
                <li>6-8 fresh mint leaves</li>
                <li>Club soda (soda water)</li>
                <li>Ice cubes</li>
                <li>Lime slices and mint sprigs for garnish</li>
                <li>Optional: Extra sugar for rimming the glass</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
                In a sturdy glass or cocktail shaker, add the mint leaves and granulated sugar.

                Gently muddle the mint leaves and sugar together using a muddler or the back of a spoon. This helps
                release the mint's oils and flavor.

                Add the freshly squeezed lime juice to the glass.

                Fill the glass with ice cubes.

                Pour the white rum over the ice.

                Stir the mixture well to combine the ingredients and chill the drink.

                Top off the glass with club soda, leaving some room at the top for garnishes.

                Optionally, you can rim the glass with sugar before adding the ingredients. To do this, moisten the rim
                of the glass with a lime wedge and dip it into a shallow plate of sugar.

                Garnish the mojito with a lime slice and a sprig of fresh mint.

                Serve immediately with a straw or stir stick.
