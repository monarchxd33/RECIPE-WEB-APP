            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
                <ul>
                <li>package (about 2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
                <li>teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cups warm water (110째F/45째C)</li>
                <li>1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>Your choice of pizza sauce</li>
                <li>Your choice of toppings (e.g., shredded mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, sliced mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            <p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
                In a small bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.
                In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Stir until a soft dough forms.
                Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, you can add a little more flour as needed.
                Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.
                Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C) and grease a pizza pan or baking sheet.
                Punch down the risen dough and transfer it to the prepared pan. Use your hands to press it out into a round shape, about 12-14 inches in diameter, or to fit your pan.
                Spread pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.
                Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, then add your desired toppings.
                Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
                Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
